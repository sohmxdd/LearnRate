# ⚡ LearnRate: Linear Regression from Scratch

**LearnRate** is an interactive and evolving Machine Learning project that starts with a manual implementation of **Linear Regression** using **Batch Gradient Descent**.  

This is just the **beginning** – as I progress in my ML journey, I’ll continuously add more algorithms and features, making this a **mini ML playground** for learning and experimentation.  

Soon, **LearnRate** will also be available as a **desktop application** via **ElectronJS**, allowing you to run it locally with a beautiful, app-like interface.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Manual Implementation** – Linear Regression and Gradient Descent coded from scratch (no scikit-learn)
- ✅ **Interactive UI** – Adjust Learning Rate (α), Iterations, and Noise via sliders
- ✅ **Animated Regression** – Watch the model converge with interactive Plotly visualizations
- ✅ **Cost Function Visualization** – See optimization progress over iterations
- ✅ **Extensible Design** – Future algorithms (Logistic Regression, Clustering, Neural Nets, etc.) planned
